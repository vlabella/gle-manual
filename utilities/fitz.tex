\section{Fitz}
\index{fitz} \label{fitz:sec}

{\sf FITZ} fits smooth curves based on a set of 3D data points. E.g., given some data points (note that each line has three values: an x, y, and z coordinate):
\begin{verbatim}
x	y	z
---- data file testf.dat -----
1 	1 	1
1 	2 	1
2 	2	1
2 	1	1
1.5 	1.5 	2
------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

Fitz creates a ".z" file that can be used in a surface block, a colormap or contour plot. The following example illustrates this.

\begin{minipage}[c]{8cm}
\begin{Verbatim}
begin fitz
   data "fitz.dat"
   x from 0 to 5 step 0.2
   y from 0 to 5 step 0.2
   ncontour 6
end fitz

begin surface
   size 7 7
   data "fitz.z"
   top color blue
   xaxis min 0 max 5 step 1
   yaxis min 0 max 5 step 1
   points "fitz.dat"
   droplines lstyle 1
   marker circle
   view 2.5 3 0.3
   harray 5000
end surface
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}
